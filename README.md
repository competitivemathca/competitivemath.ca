# competitivemath.ca

An online platform dedicated to math contest preparation through virtual contests, an automatically graded problem set, and a competitive community.
Our goal is to make math contest preparation more fun and accessible for high schools across Canada.
Created by the Bur Oak Secondary School Math Club.

**Built with:** ReactJS, TailwindCSS, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Figma for prototyping

## Description
When students sign up for competitivemath.ca, they may choose to create or enter an existing **club**, which usually represents their high school.
**Live contests** will be hosted monthly by registered clubs or our own **problem setting team**, with a set start/end time (e.g. Friday 9:00 AM - Sunday 11:59PM).
All users are invited to attend these contests, provided that they finish the contest within a specific window (e.g. 3 hours).
Each contest contains problems in various forms: numerical, multiple choice, and full solution.
The numerical and multiple choice questions will be automatically graded at the end of the contest, whereas the full solutions will be graded later by our team.
Once a user has finished a contest, their **rating** will increase based on their performance. The top rated users will be featured on the **Community tab**.
When a contest ends, all of its problems will be archived in the **Problems tab**, where users can practice outside of contests.

## How to build
The website is hosted on a domain: https://competitivemath.ca/ <br>
